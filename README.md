# trello
Build an agile board like Trello. It will have three lists (Todo, In Progress and Done). The user should be able to add a new item to the Todo list and then move around these items on the board between lists. The user can also update or delete an item from any of the lists as well as rearrange items within the list (rearranging is a good to have requirement and not mandatory). The candidate is free to use his/her own UX interaction model and design for the app (this will also give us an idea of his/her product sense). Another good to have requirement would be to retain the state of the board when the user closes the browser and later re-launches the app (this could either be done through a basic REST API or simply localStorage, but would test a basic integration flow).
1. Install npm packages with npm install
2. run "npm start" on terminal (Used command "npm start ")
3. hit url "http://localhost:3000/"
